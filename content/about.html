                fullstack work as well. As for the misleading home page, it's
                more of an aspirational title. My interests include application
                observability, reliability, and the developer experience. I have

                from technology I like reading, cycling, playing music, playing

            <p>
                This site was originally written using a custom SSG, first in
                TypeScript, then in Go. Then I realized I was bikeshedding,
                going down a rabbit hole, reinventing the wheel, chasing my
                tail, beating a dead horse, barking up the wrong tree, missing
                the forest for the trees, putting the cart before the horse, and
                boiling the ocean. Ultimately, I was just creating a worse Hugo.
                That's when I transitioned the SSG generation to Hugo.
