Writing a changelog for a SaaS platform on an Agile team means there can be a lot of entries and tickets to keep track of. I created a GitHub Action for the team that generates the changelog automatically on pull requests to production using the Claude API. The challenging part was ensuring Claude had the proper context and prompt to frame the changelog correctly. That led me to populating the prompt with a few things: the git diff, the project README, some instructions around phrasing, and the Keep a Changelog specification. The result turned out great and eliminated toil.
