I've been running into difficulty, trying to use Atlas to run database migrations in a GitHub Action workflow. The database is in a VPC which can only be accessed via a bastion host. AWS SSM port forwarding doesn't seem to work when the application is not running on the host itself. So, I've resorted to installing everything in the host (Atlas, psql, etc) and trying that.
