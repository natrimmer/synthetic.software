    <p>
      More than any other art, poetry is a form of sentimental education, and
      the lines that Akhmatova readers learned by heart were to temper their
      hearts against the new era's onslaught of vulgarity. The comprehension of
      the metaphysics of personal drama betters one's chances of weathering the
      drama of history. This is why, and not because of the epigrammatic beauty
      of her lines only, the public clung to them so unwittingly. It was an
      instinctive reaction; the instinct being that of self-preservation, for
      the stampede of history was getting more and more audible.
