            More than any other art, poetry is a form of sentimental education,
            and the lines that Akhmatova readers learned by heart were to temper
            their hearts against the new era's onslaught of vulgarity. The
            comprehension of the metaphysics of personal drama betters one's
            chances of weathering the drama of history. This is why, and not
            because of the epigrammatic beauty of her lines only, the public
            clung to them so unwittingly. It was an instinctive reaction; the
            instinct being that of self-preservation, for the stampede of
            history was getting more and more audible.

    I haven't read much of Akhmatova, but I can't help but think about Louise
    Glück's Parable of the King when I read this quote. Glück's king embodies
    exactly the kind of morally blind leadership that creates the historical
    'onslaught' Brodsky describes - and when faced with that corruption, we can
    find solace in the aspects of humanity that bring us closer, particularly
    art. It isn't prescriptive, but it is a form of perseverance.

            The great king looking ahead<br />
            saw not fate but simply<br />
            dawn glittering over<br />
            the unknown island: as a king<br />
            he thought in the imperative—best<br />
            not to reconsider direction, best<br />
            to keep going forward<br />
            over the radiant water. Anyway,<br />
            what is fate but a strategy for ignoring<br />
            history, with its moral<br />
            dilemmas, a way of regarding<br />
            the present, where decisions<br />
            are made, as the necessary<br />
            link between the past (images of the king<br />
            as a young prince) and the glorious future (images<br />
            of slave girls). Whatever<br />
            it was ahead, why did it have to be<br />
            so blinding? Who could have known<br />
            that wasn't the usual sun<br />
            but flames rising over a world<br />
            about to become extinct?
