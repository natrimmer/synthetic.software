<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Background</h2>
<p class="mb-2">
    Sharing and working in public is an ideal that I try to aspire to. Those are
    two different ideas worth exploring. Sharing in this context means sharing
    the great work of others, and helping them get more visibility in the small
    way that I can. Working in public, in this context, means sharing more of my
    own habits, routines, and the way I live, engage in the world. The blogroll
    does both of these. It shares writings of others, and it shares what I am
    reading and what I find interesting. It does so in an interesting way as
    well. That's what I'll break down here.
</p>
<p class="mb-2">
    If you're already here wondering what the blogroll I'm referring to is, you
    should visit it
    <a
        href="/blogroll"
        class="underline hover:text-mondrian_red transition-colors"
        >here</a
    >
    and come back. That being said, a blogroll is a list of links to blogs and
    websites updated using RSS/Atom feeds. It is a way to aggregate content from
    multiple sources into one place, allowing readers to curate their own
    personalized media feed. The inspiration for this blogroll comes from Alex
    Kladov's blog "matklad", specifically the post
    <a
        href="https://matklad.github.io/2025/06/26/rssssr.html"
        class="underline hover:text-mondrian_red transition-colors"
        aria-label="matklad's blog post: RSS Server Side Reader"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        target="_blank"
        title="matklad's blog post: RSS Server Side Reader"
        >"RSS Server Side Reader"</a
    >. If you want to know more about RSS/Atom feeds, you should read their
    brief primer on it in that post. It explains it better than I could.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">How it works</h2>
<p>
    Using devenv for my environment and dependency management, I created a
    wrapper script around the
    <code class="code-inline">hugo build</code>
    command. The wrapper script through a series of nested calls builds a Go
    binary that generates a Hugo data file called
    <code class="code-inline">blogroll.yaml</code>. This file is then used by a
    Hugo template to render the blogroll page. I'll break down each component
    below.
