<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Background</h2>
<p class="mb-2">
    Sharing and working in public is an ideal that I try to aspire to. Those are
    two different ideas worth exploring. Sharing in this context means sharing
    the great work of others, and helping them get more visibility in the small
    way that I can. Working in public, in this context, means sharing more of my
    own habits, routines, and the way I live, engage in the world. The blogroll
    does both of these. It shares writings of others, and it shares what I am
    reading and what I find interesting. It does so in an interesting way as
    well. That's what I'll break down here.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
    If you're already here wondering what the blogroll I'm referring to is, you
    should visit it
    <a
        href="/blogroll"
        class="underline hover:text-mondrian_red transition-colors"
        >here</a
    >
    and come back. That being said, a blogroll is a list of links to blogs and
    websites updated using RSS/Atom feeds. It is a way to aggregate content from
    multiple sources into one place, allowing readers to curate their own
    personalized media feed. The inspiration for this blogroll comes from Alex
    Kladov's blog "matklad", specifically the post
    <a
        href="https://matklad.github.io/2025/06/26/rssssr.html"
        class="underline hover:text-mondrian_red transition-colors"
        aria-label="matklad's blog post: RSS Server Side Reader"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        target="_blank"
        title="matklad's blog post: RSS Server Side Reader"
        >"RSS Server Side Reader"</a
    >. If you want to know more about RSS/Atom feeds, you should read their
    brief primer on it in that post. It explains it better than I could.
</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">How it works</h2>
<p class="mb-2">
    The goal of software is to abstract away complexity. I take the same
    approach when building my development environment and CI/CD pipelines. This
    allows for easy and reliable builds, and during development, it serves as a
    reproducible way to perform common tasks with minimal overhead.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
    My blogroll implementation has three main components: a build wrapper script
    that orchestrates everything, a Go binary that fetches RSS feeds and
    generates data, and a Hugo template that renders the final page. Let me walk
    through how they work together.
</p>
<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Build Wrapper Script</h3>
<p class="mb-2">
    Hugo doesn't have built-in hooks for running arbitrary commands during the
    build process, so I created a wrapper script around
    <code class="code-inline">hugo build</code> using devenv. Devenv allows you
    to define your development environment declaratively in a
    <code class="code-inline">devenv.nix</code> file, including dependencies,
    scripts, processes, and precommit hooks.
</p>
<p class="mb-2">
    The wrapper script preprocesses data before Hugo generates the production
    build. When I run <code class="code-inline">hugo-build</code> (locally or in
    CI), it triggers this call stack:
</p>
<ol class="list-decimal list-outside pl-4 mb-4">
    <li>
        <code class="code-inline">hugo-build:</code> preprocesses data and
        provides Hugo with additional build data
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="code-inline">hugo-update-blogroll:</code> calls the Go
        blogroll generator
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="code-inline">blogroll-generator-run:</code> ensures the
        binary is built and runs it
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="code-inline">blogroll-generator-build:</code> builds the Go
        binary
    </li>
</ol>
<p class="mb-4">
    This creates a <code class="code-inline">blogroll.yaml</code> data file that
    Hugo can use during its build process. All of these scripts can be called
    individually for development purposes, but the stack is designed to be
    simple to use in practice.
</p>
<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Go Code</h3>
<p class="mb-2">
    The Go program is responsible for fetching RSS feeds from
    <a
        href="/assets/blogroll.txt"
        class="code-inline underline transition-colors hover:text-mondrian_blue"
        aria-label="Link to static plaintext blogroll.txt"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >/static/assets/blogroll.txt</a
    >, parsing them, and generating a YAML file that Hugo can use. The program
    is intended to be error resilient, if one feed is down or malformed, it logs
    the error and continues processing the rest rather than failing the entire
    build.
</p>
<p class="mb-2">
    I deliberately keep the extracted data minimal: title, URL, date, domain,
    and feed URL. This gives readers enough context to decide what interests
    them without overwhelming the page. The program handles both RSS and Atom
    formats by attempting RSS parsing first, then falling back to Atom if that
    fails.
</p>
<p class="mb-2">
    One of the more interesting aspects was date parsing. RSS and Atom feeds use
    wildly different date formats, so the parser tries nine different time
    formats before giving up on a post. The program also limits each feed to the
    three most recent posts, then sorts everything chronologically across all
    feeds to create a unified timeline.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
    The blogroll.txt file supports comments (lines starting with #) and
    automatically filters out empty lines, making it easy to organize and
    temporarily disable feeds without deleting URLs entirely.
</p>
<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Hugo Template</h3>
<p class="mb-2">
    The Hugo template is where the blogroll comes to life visually. I wanted to
    create something that felt distinctly technical while remaining readable, so
    I designed it around a terminal aesthetic that would resonate with the
    developer audience likely to discover RSS feeds interesting.
</p>
<p class="mb-2">
    The template starts with a simulated <code class="code-inline">bat</code>
    command output showing the contents of blogroll.txt. This serves both as
    transparency (showing exactly which feeds are being followed) and as a
    visual hook. The template deduplicates feed URLs for this display since
    multiple recent posts can come from the same feed, building up a unique list
    as it processes the data. The template handles the case where no blogroll
    data exists, showing helpful instructions to run the generator.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
    Below that, the posts are displayed in a clean table format with hover
    effects and external link indicators. I used semantic HTML throughout:
    proper table headers with <code class="code-inline">scope</code> attributes,
    <code class="code-inline">time</code> elements with
    <code class="code-inline">datetime</code> attributes, and descriptive
    <code class="code-inline">aria-label</code> text for screen readers.
</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p class="mb-2">
    Building this blogroll was as much about the process as the outcome. By
    sharing both what I read and how I built the tool, I'm hoping to embody both
    aspects of working in public: amplifying others' voices while being
    transparent about my own methods and choices.
