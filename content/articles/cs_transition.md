I just turned 29, and this year will bring a lot of change. I'll be graduating from college this year, getting a long sought degree, Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. Not many folks in my family have a college degree, and having grown up with a chip on my shoulder regarding authority, educational, religious, governmental, etc., I was a bit adverse to continuing my education after high school. That is an incredibly brief accounting of my educational journey, but for this conversation, it will suffice.

I want to reflect on this experience, transitioning out of my current career into software development.

My degree is not exactly a vocational training program to be a software developer (there are many of those, and yet that focused instruction is often not sought after by employers anyway). Rather, it is a broad computer science degree, designed to teach me how computers work on a fundamental level. That discrepancy leads to a gap in practical education. The expectations of employers are: practical experience and the education to boot. Therefore that gap must be filled by extensive studying outside of my degree's curriculum. Throw in a full-time job and a family, and you're left with limited time. That stack of responsibilities has become an over promise of my time. It is incredibly difficult to manage, and it is equally frustrating as a result.

This leads one to exclaim, "Those are just the consequences of your actions!" This is true. They certainly are. I am the one who underestimated the amount of extra time needed to gain experience and skills in technologies I won't learn during my CS program. To those saying that, trust me I understand that. Please don't tell me. To those considering a similar path, I have more to say.

## Competitive and Desirable

Messaging about this kind of transition is mixed to say the least. However, you'll find the louder voices, being the more flippant with claims about ease and outcome.

You'll find lists of steps on how to transition into the software field. It'll include things like: get an internship, contribute to open source, create a portfolio. What is often excluded from action item lists is the amount of work it takes to do those things meaningfully in a way that provides a deep understanding of what you're doing.

Obtaining an internship, a junior position, an entry level position, or a new grad position requires as much work as a part time job right now. For some perspective, I'm receiving responses from about 10% of my applications. I have submitted around **120** already. Now, to some CS majors, this number will not be shocking in the slightest. To others in different fields, I suspect, as I have, this magnitude of non response and rejection is mind boggling. I have seen other applicants claim over **700**. Take it with a grain of salt, but it isn't impossible.

This is just a small indicator of the state of competition right now. When I began this journey, I was told consistently that there is a surplus of jobs and that it is only growing. Ultimately, that is probably true. However, the massive push for more developers coupled with a global pandemic-led hiring freeze has led to remarkable numbers of applicants competing for scraps.

At this point, companies want mid-level engineers because the risk is much lower and the financial loss is only marginally higher. This is entirely understandable from a financial point of view. However, if the amount of anticipated growth is true, all of these folks entering the field will need somewhere to enter.

This is a desirable field. It has a lot of life benefits and infinite depth. Often, that is all you'll hear. If you're considering this path, go out of your way to see the full picture. Sometimes we have a tendency to see big life choices through rose colored glasses. Ironically, that can hinder your ability to navigate the difficulties of these choices.

## On A More Personal Note

I have limited time and so many interests in this field. I want to study and learn more about Rust, the Linux kernel, application security, deployment and build technologies, networking, OS security, among other things. These are complicated topics and people spend their whole lives studying and working on them. While I engage with those technologies, I'm often saddened by my inability to engage with them on a deeper level more regularly.

This reflection has helped me remember to be more patient with myself and this path. It has already given me more than I can communicate, and I am confident it will be a source of joy, stability, and mental stimulation for the rest of my life.

I am optimistic these issues will be resolved. In the meantime, honest conversations need to be had about the current prospects here.
