Curious little snippet that leaked through a Claude Code session:

<system-reminder>
Whenever you write a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious. If it does, you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer high-level questions about the code behavior.
